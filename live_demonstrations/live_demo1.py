    Import the sys and numpy modules.
    Defines a main() function.
    In the main() function:
    - Define variable x and initializes its value to 0.0. 
    - Use a for loop to iterate a variable i from 0 to 19 inclusive.
    - For each value of i, set the value of x to be twice i plus 19 as a float.
    - Use an f-string to print() out the value of x, including the text string ”The value of x is = “.
    Use the if __name__==“__main__”: conditional to call main().
